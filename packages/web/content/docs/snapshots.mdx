description: Git-based snapshots for undo and revert.

Arctic uses Git‑based snapshots to track your working tree state. This enables safe undo/revert and benchmarking workflows.

## What snapshots are for

- Undo AI changes
- Compare changes in a session
- Apply and revert benchmark results

## Where snapshots live

Snapshots use a separate Git repository:

```
~/.local/share/arctic/snapshot/<projectID>/
```

This is separate from your project’s `.git` directory.

## View diffs

```bash
arctic session diff <session-id>
```

## Restore from a snapshot

```bash
arctic debug snapshot restore <hash>
```

## Toggle snapshots

```json
{
  "snapshot": true
}
```
