description: Built‑in tools and how they behave.

Arctic exposes a curated toolset to the model. Tools are permission‑gated and can be disabled per agent.

## Built‑in tools

- `bash` — run shell commands
- `read` / `write` / `edit` — file access
- `list` / `glob` / `grep` — file discovery and search
- `webfetch` — fetch URLs as text
- `websearch` / `codesearch` — web and code search (requires Arctic provider or `ARCTIC_ENABLE_EXA`)
- `task` — spawn a sub‑agent session
- `todowrite` / `todoread` — per‑session todo list
- `batch` — run tools in parallel

## Controlling tools

Tools can be limited by:

- Agent frontmatter (`tools` and `permission`)
- Global config (`tools`, `permission`)

See [Permissions](/docs/cli/permissions).
