Arctic aggregates usage and limits across providers in one place.

## Command

```bash
arctic run --command usage
```

## TUI shortcut

In the TUI prompt:

```
/usage
```

This opens the Usage dialog.

## What you’ll see

- **Provider tabs**: switch providers with `Tab`
- **Access status**: allowed / blocked / limit reached
- **Plan** (if available)
- **Updated time**
- **Token usage**: total/input/output/cached
- **Cost summary**: total + breakdown (if available)
- **Limits**: primary/secondary windows with % remaining + reset time

### Time periods (Anthropic + Z.ai)

For Anthropic and Z.ai coding plans, you can switch the time window in the dialog:

- `1` Session
- `2` Daily
- `3` Weekly
- `4` Monthly

If a provider doesn’t expose limits, it will show “unknown.”
