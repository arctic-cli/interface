description: Compare models on the same task.

Benchmarking lets you run the same prompt across multiple models, isolate changes, and apply the best result.

## Start a benchmark (TUI)

In the TUI prompt:

```
/benchmark start
```

This creates a **parent** session and **child** sessions for each model you select.

## Common commands

```
/benchmark stop
/benchmark next
/benchmark prev
/benchmark apply
/benchmark undo
```

### Shortcuts (default)

- Next session: `ctrl+shift+right`
- Previous session: `ctrl+shift+left`
- Apply changes: `ctrl+alt+a`
- Undo changes: `ctrl+alt+u`

## Typical flow

1. Run `/benchmark start` and choose models
2. Switch children with `/benchmark next` / `/benchmark prev`
3. Apply a child’s changes with `/benchmark apply`
4. Undo with `/benchmark undo`
5. Exit with `/benchmark stop`
