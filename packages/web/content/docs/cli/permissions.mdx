description: Control what the model can do.

Permissions control file edits, shell commands, and web access. They can be set globally or per‑agent.

## Permission types

- `edit`
- `bash` (supports wildcard patterns)
- `webfetch`
- `external_directory`

Each can be set to:

- `allow`
- `ask`
- `deny`

When prompted, you can allow **once**, **always**, or **reject** for the current session.

## Example (agent)

```md
---
permission:
  edit: ask
  bash:
    "*": ask
  webfetch: deny
---
```

## Example (config)

```json
{
  "permission": {
    "edit": "ask",
    "webfetch": "ask",
    "bash": {
      "*": "ask",
      "git *": "allow"
    }
  }
}
```
