Sessions are the core unit of conversation in Arctic. Every interaction with a model happens inside a session.

## Create sessions

- **TUI**: `arctic` starts a new session automatically.
- **CLI**: `arctic run "..."` creates a session for the prompt.

## List sessions

```bash
arctic session list
```

## Resume sessions

Continue the most recent session:

```bash
arctic run --continue "follow‑up question"
```

Resume a specific session:

```bash
arctic run --session <session-id> "follow‑up question"
```

## Fork sessions

Fork to explore a different approach without losing the original:

```bash
arctic session fork <session-id>
```

Fork from a specific message (exclusive):

```bash
arctic session fork <session-id> <message-id>
```

## Delete sessions

```bash
arctic session delete <session-id>
```

## Export / import

```bash
arctic export <session-id>
arctic import <file-or-url>
```

## Diffs and snapshots

See file changes made in a session:

```bash
arctic session diff <session-id>
```

Snapshots also power undo/revert and benchmarking. See [Snapshots](/docs/snapshots).
