description: Sign in and manage credentials.

## Quick Start

```bash
arctic auth login
```

Choose a provider and follow the browser flow. Credentials are stored in `~/.config/arctic/auth.json`.

## API Key Providers

For providers that use API keys, set environment variables before launching Arctic:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="..."
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="..."
export GOOGLE_API_KEY="..."
```

Arctic auto‑detects these values on startup.

## OAuth Providers

Some providers use OAuth/device login (e.g., Codex, GitHub Copilot, Google). Run:

```bash
arctic auth login
```

Arctic handles token refresh automatically.

## Import Existing Credentials

Arctic automatically detects and offers to import credentials from:

- **Codex CLI**: `~/.codex/auth.json`
- **Claude Code**: Imported automatically on first launch if configured

When you first launch Arctic, it will scan for existing auth files and prompt you to import them. You can also manually trigger imports by running:

```bash
arctic auth login
```

And selecting the import option if available.

## Manage Credentials

```bash
arctic auth list
arctic auth logout
```
