The Arctic TUI (Terminal User Interface) is the primary way to interact with models. It’s keyboard‑first and fast.

## Launch

```bash
arctic
```

## Layout

- **Input** (bottom): type prompts
- **Messages** (center): conversation history
- **Sidebar** (left): session info, navigation
- **Header** (top): model, agent, session
- **Footer** (bottom): status + hints

## Input

- `Enter` submits
- `Ctrl+J` inserts a newline
- `Up/Down` cycles prompt history

### Ctrl+C behavior

`Ctrl+C` is context‑aware:

- If there is selected text, it copies the selection.
- If there is input text, it clears the input.
- If pressed twice quickly, it exits the CLI.

## Essential shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Ctrl+X Q` | Quit Arctic |
| `Ctrl+X M` | Model picker |
| `Ctrl+X A` | Agent picker |
| `Ctrl+X N` | New session |
| `Ctrl+X L` | Session list |
| `Ctrl+P` | Command palette |
| `Ctrl+X /` | Run slash command |
| `Ctrl+X B` | Toggle sidebar |
| `Ctrl+X H` | Toggle code block concealment |

## Sessions

- Start a new session: `Ctrl+X N`
- Switch sessions: `Ctrl+X L`
- Timeline view: `Ctrl+X G`

## Models and agents

- Pick a model: `Ctrl+X M`
- Pick an agent: `Ctrl+X A`

Both dialogs support search and quick filter.

## Tools and streaming

As responses stream you’ll see tool usage (bash/read/edit/etc.) inline with the message output.

## Copy & selection

- Mouse select to copy
- Keyboard select with `Shift` + arrows
- Copy entire message: `Ctrl+X Y`

## Dialogs

### Model picker

Search and select models with details like provider and context size.

### Agent picker

Select or create agents. Shows description, mode, and model override.

### Session list

Browse sessions, view last updated time, and delete sessions.

### Command palette

Search and run actions quickly.

### Theme picker

Pick a theme or load one from config.

## Customization

### Keybindings

Override keybindings in config:

```json
{
  "keybinds": {
    "quit": "ctrl+q",
    "model_picker": "ctrl+m",
    "new_session": "ctrl+n"
  }
}
```

### Themes

Set a theme name in config and provide a theme file:

```json
{
  "theme": "my-theme"
}
```

Create `~/.config/arctic/themes/my-theme.json`:

```json
{
  "background": "#1a1a1a",
  "foreground": "#e0e0e0",
  "primary": "#00ff00",
  "secondary": "#ff00ff",
  "accent": "#00ffff",
  "error": "#ff0000"
}
```

## Troubleshooting

If the TUI looks wrong:

```bash
reset
```

If keybindings don’t work, check terminal settings and consider remapping in config.
