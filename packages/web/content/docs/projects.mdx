description: How Arctic groups sessions and config by project.
---

Arctic groups sessions by **project**. A project is usually your Git worktree root.

## How projects are detected

- **Git repo**: the worktree root is the project
- **No Git**: the current directory is the project

This keeps sessions, snapshots, and config isolated per project.

## Project config

Create `.arctic/arctic.json` in your repo to override global settings:

```json
{
  "model": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5",
  "enabled_providers": ["anthropic", "openai"]
}
```

Config precedence (later wins):

1. Global: `~/.config/arctic/arctic.json`
2. Project: `<worktree>/.arctic/arctic.json`
3. Directory: `<directory>/arctic.json`

## Storage layout (simplified)

Project‑scoped data lives under `~/.local/share/arctic/storage/`:

- Sessions: `storage/session/<projectID>/<sessionID>.json`
- Messages: `storage/message/<sessionID>/<messageID>.json`
- Parts: `storage/part/<messageID>/<partID>.json`

Snapshots are stored separately:

- `~/.local/share/arctic/snapshot/<projectID>/`
