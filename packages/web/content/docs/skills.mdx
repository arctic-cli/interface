description: Reusable prompt templates for specialized tasks.
---

Skills are reusable prompt templates that provide specialized instructions and context for specific tasks. They're stored as markdown files with frontmatter and can be discovered and loaded dynamically by the AI.

## What are Skills?

Skills are like mini-agents or prompt templates that can be invoked on-demand. They provide:

- **Specialized instructions** for specific tasks (e.g., code reviews, git workflows, documentation)
- **Tool restrictions** to limit what operations the skill can perform
- **Reusability** across projects and sessions
- **Discoverability** through search

Unlike agents, skills are loaded dynamically during a conversation when needed, rather than being selected at the start of a session.

## Creating a Skill

Skills are stored as markdown files in:

- **Global**: `~/.config/arctic/skills/*.md`
- **Project**: `.arctic/skills/*.md`, `.agent/skills/*.md`, or `.opencode/skills/*.md`

Arctic supports multiple project directory structures (`.arctic/`, `.agent/`, `.opencode/`) for compatibility with different tools and workflows. Skills can be organized in subdirectories within the `skills/` folder for better organization.

### Skill File Format

```md
---
name: code-review
description: Perform thorough code reviews with security and performance analysis
compatibility: ["arctic", "claude-code", "cursor"]
license: MIT
argument-hint: ["file-path", "focus-area"]
allowed-tools: ["read", "grep", "glob"]
disable-model-invocation: false
metadata:
  author: Your Name
  version: 1.0.0
---

You are an expert code reviewer. When reviewing code:

1. Check for security vulnerabilities
2. Identify performance bottlenecks
3. Suggest improvements for readability
4. Verify error handling
5. Check for edge cases

Focus on constructive feedback and provide specific examples.
```

### Frontmatter Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | string | ✅ | Unique identifier for the skill |
| `description` | string | ✅ | What the skill does (min 20 chars) |
| `compatibility` | string[] | ❌ | Compatible tools/platforms |
| `license` | string | ❌ | License for the skill |
| `argument-hint` | string[] | ❌ | Hints for expected arguments |
| `allowed-tools` | string[] | ❌ | Tools the skill can use |
| `disable-model-invocation` | boolean | ❌ | Prevent auto-activation |
| `metadata` | object | ❌ | Additional key-value pairs |

## Using Skills

### In the TUI

Skills are automatically available to the AI through two built-in tools:

1. **`skill_find`** - Search for available skills
2. **`skill_use`** - Load one or more skills by name

The AI can discover and use skills automatically when appropriate. You can also explicitly request a skill:

```
Use the code-review skill to review src/index.ts
```

### In CLI

Skills are loaded automatically when the AI needs them. You can also create custom commands that use specific skills.

### Programmatically

Skills can be accessed via the registry:

```ts
import { SkillRegistry } from "@/skill"

// Search for skills
const results = await SkillRegistry.search("code review")

// Get a specific skill
const skill = await SkillRegistry.get("code-review")

// List all skills
const allSkills = await SkillRegistry.all()
```

## Skill Examples

### Git Release Skill

```md
---
name: git-release
description: Create a new git release with changelog generation and version bumping
allowed-tools: ["bash", "read", "write", "grep"]
argument-hint: ["version", "release-type"]
---

You are a release manager. When creating a release:

1. Verify the working directory is clean
2. Generate a changelog from git commits
3. Update version numbers in package files
4. Create a git tag
5. Push the tag to remote

Always confirm the version number before proceeding.
```

### Documentation Writer Skill

```md
---
name: doc-writer
description: Write comprehensive documentation with examples and best practices
allowed-tools: ["read", "write", "glob", "grep"]
compatibility: ["arctic", "claude-code"]
---

You are a technical documentation specialist. When writing docs:

1. Start with a clear overview
2. Include practical examples
3. Document all parameters and return values
4. Add troubleshooting sections
5. Use consistent formatting

Follow the existing documentation style in the project.
```

### Security Auditor Skill

```md
---
name: security-audit
description: Perform security audits focusing on common vulnerabilities and best practices
allowed-tools: ["read", "grep", "glob"]
disable-model-invocation: true
---

You are a security auditor. When auditing code:

1. Check for SQL injection vulnerabilities
2. Verify input validation
3. Check for XSS vulnerabilities
4. Verify authentication and authorization
5. Check for sensitive data exposure
6. Review dependency security

Provide severity ratings (Critical, High, Medium, Low) for each finding.
```

### Test Generator Skill

```md
---
name: test-generator
description: Generate comprehensive unit and integration tests with edge cases
allowed-tools: ["read", "write", "glob"]
argument-hint: ["file-path", "test-framework"]
---

You are a test engineer. When generating tests:

1. Cover happy paths
2. Test edge cases
3. Test error conditions
4. Mock external dependencies
5. Ensure tests are isolated
6. Follow the project's testing conventions

Generate tests that are maintainable and well-documented.
```

## Best Practices

### Naming

- Use kebab-case for skill names
- Choose descriptive, specific names
- Avoid generic names like "helper" or "utility"

### Description

- Write clear, concise descriptions (minimum 20 characters)
- Explain what the skill does and when to use it
- Include key capabilities

### Tool Restrictions

Use `allowed-tools` to limit what the skill can do:

```yaml
allowed-tools: ["read", "grep", "glob"]  # Read-only operations
```

This prevents skills from making unintended changes.

### Argument Hints

Provide hints for expected arguments:

```yaml
argument-hint: ["file-path", "severity-level", "output-format"]
```

This helps the AI understand how to use the skill.

### Disable Auto-Invocation

For sensitive operations, prevent automatic activation:

```yaml
disable-model-invocation: true
```

The skill must be explicitly requested by the user.

## Skill Discovery

The AI can search for skills using natural language:

```
Find skills related to testing
```

This uses the `skill_find` tool to search skill names and descriptions.

## Skill vs Agent vs Command

| Feature | Skill | Agent | Command |
|---------|-------|-------|---------|
| **When loaded** | On-demand | Session start | Explicit invocation |
| **Scope** | Task-specific | Conversation-wide | Single execution |
| **Tool control** | `allowed-tools` | `tools` + `permission` | Inherits from agent |
| **Reusability** | High | Medium | High |
| **Use case** | Specialized tasks | Conversation style | Templated prompts |

### When to Use Each

**Use Skills when:**
- You have reusable task-specific instructions
- You want the AI to discover and use them automatically
- You need tool restrictions per task

**Use Agents when:**
- You want to set the conversation style/persona
- You need session-wide tool permissions
- You're defining a primary assistant mode

**Use Commands when:**
- You have templated prompts with variables
- You want explicit user invocation
- You need quick shortcuts for common tasks

## Sharing Skills

Skills are portable and can be shared:

1. Export your skills directory
2. Share individual `.md` files
3. Publish to a skills repository

### Example: Sharing a Skill

```bash
# Copy a global skill to share
cp ~/.config/arctic/skills/my-skill.md ./my-skill.md

# Copy a project skill
cp .arctic/skills/my-skill.md ./my-skill.md
# or
cp .agent/skills/my-skill.md ./my-skill.md

# Share your entire skills directory
tar -czf my-skills.tar.gz ~/.config/arctic/skills/

# Share project skills
tar -czf project-skills.tar.gz .arctic/skills/
```

### Installing Shared Skills

```bash
# Install to global skills
cp shared-skill.md ~/.config/arctic/skills/

# Install to project skills
cp shared-skill.md .arctic/skills/
# or
cp shared-skill.md .agent/skills/
```

## Troubleshooting

### Skill Not Found

If a skill isn't being discovered:

1. Check the file is in the correct directory:
   - Global: `~/.config/arctic/skills/*.md`
   - Project: `.arctic/skills/*.md`, `.agent/skills/*.md`, or `.opencode/skills/*.md`
   - Skills can be in subdirectories (e.g., `skills/code-review/security.md`)
2. Verify the frontmatter is valid YAML
3. Ensure `name` and `description` are present
4. Check the description is at least 20 characters
5. Restart Arctic to reload skills

### Skill Not Loading

If a skill loads but doesn't work:

1. Check `allowed-tools` includes necessary tools
2. Verify the skill content is clear and specific
3. Test with explicit invocation first

### Skill Conflicts

If multiple skills have the same name:

- Project skills override global skills
- The most recently loaded skill wins
- Check logs for override warnings

## Advanced Usage

### Conditional Skills

Skills can include conditional logic in their content:

```md
---
name: deploy
description: Deploy application with environment-specific configuration
---

When deploying:

1. Determine the target environment (dev/staging/prod)
2. If production:
   - Require manual confirmation
   - Run full test suite
   - Create backup
3. If staging/dev:
   - Skip confirmation
   - Run smoke tests only
4. Deploy using the appropriate configuration
```

### Skill Composition

Skills can reference other skills:

```md
---
name: full-review
description: Comprehensive code review including security, performance, and style
---

Perform a comprehensive review by:

1. Use the security-audit skill to check for vulnerabilities
2. Use the performance-check skill to identify bottlenecks
3. Use the style-check skill to verify code style
4. Summarize all findings with priorities
```

### Dynamic Skills

Skills can adapt based on project context:

```md
---
name: test-runner
description: Run tests using the project's testing framework
---

Detect the testing framework used in this project:

- If Jest: run `npm test`
- If Vitest: run `npm run test`
- If Bun: run `bun test`
- If pytest: run `pytest`

Report test results and any failures.
```
