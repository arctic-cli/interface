## Installation

Arctic is distributed as a standalone binary. Install it using the install script:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://arcticli.com/install | sh
```

Or download directly from the releases page:

```
https://github.com/arctic-cli/cli/releases
```

### System Requirements

- Linux (x64, ARM64) or macOS (Intel, Apple Silicon)
- Git (recommended for snapshots)
- Terminal with 256 color support

## First Run

Launch Arctic:

```bash
arctic
```

This opens the TUI (Terminal User Interface). Press `Ctrl+X` then `Q` to exit.

## Authentication (quick)

Start the auth flow:

```bash
arctic auth login
```

Choose your provider and follow the browser flow. For API‑key providers, set environment variables (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `GOOGLE_API_KEY`).

See [Providers](/docs/providers) for full details.

## Your First Prompt

### Interactive (TUI)

```bash
arctic
```

Type your message in the input area and press `Enter`.

### One‑Shot Mode

```bash
arctic run "summarize this repo"
```

### Attach Files

```bash
arctic run -f src/index.ts "review this file"
```

Or pipe stdin:

```bash
git diff | arctic run "explain these changes"
```

## Basic Workflow

1. Start Arctic: `arctic`
2. Type your prompt and press `Enter`
3. Review the response
4. Continue the conversation
5. Switch models with `Ctrl+X M`

## Key Concepts

### Sessions

Every conversation is a **session**. Sessions are saved and can be resumed:

```bash
arctic session list
arctic run --continue
```

### Projects

Projects are auto‑detected (Git worktree). Sessions are isolated per project.

### Models

Pick a model in the TUI (`Ctrl+X M`) or in CLI:

```bash
arctic run --model openai/gpt-4o "..."
```

### Agents

Agents are custom prompts with tool rules:

```bash
arctic agent create
```

## Storage Locations

Arctic stores data in standard locations:

- **Config**: `~/.config/arctic/arctic.json`
- **Auth**: `~/.config/arctic/auth.json`
- **Sessions**: `~/.local/share/arctic/storage/session/<projectID>/`
- **Messages/Parts**: `~/.local/share/arctic/storage/message/<sessionID>/` and `~/.local/share/arctic/storage/part/<messageID>/`
- **Snapshots**: `~/.local/share/arctic/snapshot/`
